Leonardo's Ideas and Impact
</h3>
<p>
  Leonardo may have gotten his ideas from many places. Maybe he just saw how things worked and wanted to improve them. Maybe he was sold ideas. Maybe aliens. Maybe childhood experiences. Itâ€™s hard to say. I personally think it was the first thing. What do you think?

  He has a huge impact on the modern world! His designs helped invent lots of things, like bicycles and airplanes! His paintings are admired all across the globe. He even inspired other artists like michelangelo who also have a huge impact on the world!
